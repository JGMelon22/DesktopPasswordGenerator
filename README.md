# DesktopPasswordGenerator
A simple WinForms desktop application to generate passwords by changing vowels to numbers and strong password as well. 

## ðŸš€ Motivation
My father, once in a while, needs to change it's work laptop password, due to a company policy and, to make it easier, I decided to develop this application to facilitate his needs.
